## PROBLEMS FACES

### Problem 1: 
First problem we faced with installing scikit-learn because we were using python2 which don't support scikit-learn anymore so we have used python3 and create virtual envirrnment.

### Problem 2: 
Second problem we faced with kaggle we were uploading the code file instead of csv file due to which it was giving libraries error and we were unable to get output on kaggle as were getting it right on command prompt already.Then after uploading csv file we were able to get accuracy of 0.98067.

### Problem 3:
Third problem was with test file which was having scale image pixel error and when after fixing the error we trried to re upload the file it was having the size issue due to which we upload the zip file.
