## PROBLEMS FACES

### Problem 1: 
The first problem we ran into was that when searching for convolution, we came across convolution neural networks, which were solved with deep learning using tenserflow and keras, but after using the tensorflow library to apply tencique, we discovered that we needed to use scipy convolve python.

### Problem 2: 
Second, we spent four days searching for and using CNN only to find later that we wanted to use scipy and numpy instead.
