## Description ##
This repository contains assignments and project submitted to Artificial Intelligence course offered in Spring 2021 at PafKiet.

## PROBLEMS FACES

### Problem 1: 
First problem we faced with installing scikit-learn because we were using python2 which don't support scikit-learn anymore so we have used python3 and create virtual envirrnment.

### Problem 2: 
Second problem we faced with kaggle we were uploading the code file instead of csv file due to which it was giving libraries error and we were unable to get output on kaggle as were getting it right on command prompt already.Then after uploading csv file we were able to get accuracy of 0.98067.

### Problem 3:
Third problem was with test file which was having scale image pixel error and when after fixing the error we trried to re upload the file it was having the size issue due to which we upload the zip file.

## APPROACH
We have use these following approches in this project :
* Linear Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Libraries(scikit-learn,pandas,numpy,matplotlib,scipy,seaborn,math)
* Cross Validation

## DESCRIPTION
In Assignment 1 we usie Naive Bayes method, Naive Bayes is the most straightforward and fastest algorithm, suitable for largedata sets. The Naive Bayes separator is used successfully in a variety of applications such as spam filtering, text classification, emotional analysis, and complimentary programs. It uses the Bayes theorem of the possibilities of predicting an unknown category and acccuracy. We have use four techniques of Naive Bayes (1) Linear Regression (2) GuassianNB (3) BernoulliNB (4) MultimonialNB to get the best accuracy, and we get 0.98067 accuracy bu uploading file on Kaggle.
